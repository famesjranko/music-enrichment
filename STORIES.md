## Decisions

### 2026-03-21: Open-source readiness — remove opinionation

**Context**: musicmeta was extracted from Cascade (Android music player) as a standalone library. A review found several hardcoded values and Cascade-specific assumptions that would limit adoption by other apps.

**Changes**:
- Provider chain priorities made configurable via `EnrichmentConfig.priorityOverrides`. Apps can reorder which provider is tried first for each enrichment type without modifying provider code.
- Artwork sizes moved from engine-level config to per-provider constructor params. Each API has different size semantics (CAA uses pixel sizes in URLs, iTunes uses string replacement, Wikidata uses width params), so a single "preferred size" in config was misleading — it wasn't wired to anything.
- MusicBrainz `minMatchScore` (was hardcoded at 80) now a constructor param. Apps with obscure catalogs or non-Latin scripts can lower it.
- `ArtistMatcher.isMatch()` token overlap threshold now configurable (was hardcoded 0.5).
- Room database name extracted to a public constant so apps know what to change.
- All silent `catch (_: Exception)` blocks now log through `EnrichmentLogger`.
- Removed all Cascade references from test User-Agent strings.

**Rationale**: A library should let consumers tune behavior without forking. Constructor params with sensible defaults preserve backwards compatibility while opening up flexibility.

**Status**: Active

### 2026-03-21: Extraction from Cascade

**Context**: Cascade's metadata enrichment started as in-app API clients (MusicBrainz, Wikidata, Cover Art Archive). As the provider count grew to 11, the enrichment logic outgrew the app's data layer. The engine also has value as a standalone open-source library.

**Decision**: Extract into a two-module library:
- `musicmeta-core` (pure Kotlin/JVM) — engine, providers, HTTP, caching interface. Zero Android dependencies.
- `musicmeta-android` (optional) — Room cache, Hilt DI wiring, WorkManager base worker.

**Architecture**:
- `EnrichmentEngine` orchestrates the pipeline: cache check → identity resolution → fan-out to provider chains → confidence filtering → cache store.
- `ProviderRegistry` builds a `ProviderChain` per `EnrichmentType`, ordered by `ProviderCapability.priority`. The chain tries providers in order; `Success` short-circuits, `NotFound` falls through.
- Each provider is self-contained: own `*Api.kt` (HTTP), `*Models.kt` (parsing), `*Provider.kt` (enrichment logic). Adding a provider means implementing `EnrichmentProvider` — no engine changes needed.
- `CircuitBreaker` per provider (shared across chains) protects against cascading failures from a single degraded API.

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pro**: Reusable across apps, testable in isolation, pure Kotlin core runs on any JVM
- **Pro**: Provider architecture is open/closed — add new sources without modifying engine
- **Con**: Cascade's data layer now needs a mapping layer between engine types and domain models
- **Con**: JitPack dependency for consumers (vs composite build alternative)

**Key design choice — MusicBrainz as identity backbone**: MusicBrainz resolves MBIDs, Wikidata IDs, and Wikipedia titles. Downstream providers (Cover Art Archive, Wikidata, Wikipedia, Fanart.tv) use these IDs for precise lookups instead of fuzzy search. This dramatically improves accuracy but means MusicBrainz is a soft dependency. `enableIdentityResolution = false` provides an escape hatch.
